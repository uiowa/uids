1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,380
When you go through the university,
whether it's four years or whatever time

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,740
you spend there, those are arguably the
most formative years of your life.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,680
It sets the stage for what the rest of
your career is going to be.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,540
I'm blessed to be surrounded by thousands of the
smartest aerospace engineers in the world.

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,600
I always tell my management team
you can't be a good manager if you don't

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,660
understand what it is you're you're
managing, and so you have to continue to learn.

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,000
One great thing about engineers is
they're great teachers, so every day I

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,960
learn something new from our engineers.

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,380
One thing that's great about being a Hawkeye is no matter where you go, wherever you go, and I've walked

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,880
on the walls of Beijing and right there is
someone wearing a Hawkeye shirt.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,180
They're everywhere and they stay together

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,080
Once a Hawkeye always a Hawkeye

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:59,500
and wherever you live we still have that
bond that brings us together.
