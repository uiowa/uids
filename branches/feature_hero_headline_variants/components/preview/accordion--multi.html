      <p>Among the most popular of all cookie types, the chocolate chip cookie's invention was a happy accident. In 1930, Ruth Graves Wakefield, who ran the Toll House Inn in Whitman, Massachusetts, ran out of baker's chocolate and substituted for it with pieces of Nestle's® semi-sweet chocolate. </p>

      <p>Although the origin of this beloved cookie is up for debate, there's no doubt it's a favorite during the holidays. Snickerdoodles are a type of drop cookie (any cookie that is formed by dropping spoonfuls of dough directly onto a baking sheet) that is coated in cinnamon and sugar. </p>
