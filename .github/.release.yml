## This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
#
name: Build and release
#
## Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
## events but only for the master branch
#on:
#  push:
#    branches: [ master ]
#  pull_request:
#    branches: [ master ]
#
## A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
#jobs:
#  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
#  build:
#    # The type of runner that the job will run on
#    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#
#    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
#    steps:
#      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
