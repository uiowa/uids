When you go through the university.
whether it's four years or whatever time

you spend there. those are arguably the
most formative years of your life.

It sets the stage for what the rest of

I'm blessed to be surrounded by thousands of the
smartest aerospace engineers in the world.

I always tell my management team
you can't be a good manager if you don't

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.660 line:100% position:50% align:middle

they're great teachers. so every day I

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.960
learn something new from our engineers.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.380
One thing that's great about being a Hawkeye is no matter where you go. wherever you go. and I've walked

10
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.880
on the walls of Beijing and right there is
someone wearing a Hawkeye shirt.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.180
They're everywhere and they stay together

12
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.080
Once a Hawkeye always a Hawkeye

13
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:59.500
and wherever you live we still have that
bond that brings us together.
