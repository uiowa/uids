I've had a love of football since I grew

0:00:03.750,0:00:07.859 line:100% position:50% align:middle
up watching football with my dad

0:00:05.640,0:00:13.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
watching the Vikings just that alone

0:00:07.859,0:00:13.550 line:100% position:50% align:middle
makes this job really a dream come true

0:00:14.299,0:00:19.050 line:100% position:50% align:middle
I think one of the things that I really

0:00:17.609,0:00:21.240 line:100% position:50% align:middle
learned about was just the excitement

0:00:19.050,0:00:22.970
and passion of fans and how you can use

0:00:21.240,0:00:25.230
sports and athletics to create that

0:00:22.970,0:00:26.789
impactful moment and it's something

0:00:25.230,0:00:30.330
that's gonna resonate with fans for

0:00:26.789,0:00:32.250
years and years to come the smiles that

0:00:30.330,0:00:33.690
you get from an event that we do it

0:00:32.250,0:00:36.149
makes it all the hard work worthwhile

0:00:33.690,0:00:38.879
and that started you know back at the

0:00:36.149,0:00:41.040
University of Iowa Iowa really gave me

0:00:38.879,0:00:43.050
the tools to bring into the work force

0:00:41.040,0:00:45.030
the concepts that I learned in the

0:00:43.050,0:00:47.329
classroom really kind of formed me to

0:00:45.030,0:00:47.329
Who I am
